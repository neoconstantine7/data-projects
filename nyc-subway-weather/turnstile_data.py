def fix_turnstile_data(filenames):
    '''
    Filenames is a list of MTA Subway turnstile text files. A link to an example
    MTA Subway turnstile text file can be seen at the URL below:
    http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_110507.txt
    
    As you can see, there are numerous data points included in each row of the
    a MTA Subway turnstile text file. 

    You want to write a function that will update each row in the text
    file so there is only one entry per row. A few examples below:
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,00:00:00,REGULAR,003178521,001100739
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,04:00:00,REGULAR,003178541,001100746
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,08:00:00,REGULAR,003178559,001100775
    
    Write the updates to a different text file in the format of "updated_" + filename.
    For example:
        1) if you read in a text file called "turnstile_110521.txt"
        2) you should write the updated data to "updated_turnstile_110521.txt"

    The order of the fields should be preserved. 
    
    You can see a sample of the turnstile text file that's passed into this function
    and the the corresponding updated file in the links below:

    them into one file located at output_file.  There should be ONE row with the column
    headers, located at the top of the file.
    
    For example, if file_1 has:
    'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn'
    line 1 ...

def filter_by_regular(filename):
    '''
    This function should read the csv file located at filename into a pandas dataframe,
    and filter the dataframe to only rows where the 'DESCn' column has the value 'REGULAR'.
    
    For example, if the pandas dataframe is as follows:
    ,C/A,UNIT,SCP,DATEn,TIMEn,DESCn,ENTRIESn,EXITSn
    0,A002,R051,02-00-00,05-01-11,00:00:00,REGULAR,3144312,1088151

    has the value 'REGULAR':

    The data in the MTA Subway Turnstile data reports on the cumulative

    these cumulative entry numbers to a count of entries since the last reading
    (i.e., entries since the last row in the dataframe).

       1) Create a new column called ENTRIESn_hourly
